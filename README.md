This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bangalore using a machine learning model based on linear regression. The model utilizes various steps including data collection, cleaning, outlier removal, visualization, and deployment via Streamlit.

Overview:
This repository contains the code and materials for a machine learning model that predicts house prices in Bangalore, India. The model is built on the foundation of linear regression.

Project Steps
1. Data Collection
The dataset used in this project was collected from [insert data source here]. It contains various features related to houses in Bangalore, such as area, number of bedrooms, location, etc.
2. Data Cleaning
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and dealing with any duplicate entries to ensure data quality.
3. Outlier Detection and Removal
Identified outliers in the dataset that could potentially impact the model's performance. These outliers were carefully removed to enhance the model's accuracy.
4. Data Visualization
Utilized data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset and understand relationships between different features. Matplotlib or Seaborn libraries may have been used for this purpose.
5. Model Building
Built a linear regression model using the cleaned dataset. The model was trained to predict house prices based on relevant features.
6. Deployment using Streamlit
The model is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the model, allowing users to input parameters and get predicted house prices.
